### DATASCI W209 - Assignment \#4

This  line chart is constructed from a CSV file storing the date and number of miles I've run over the last few months.

Updates from [Assignment 3](http://bl.ocks.org/gregce/f3aafce344c61a8b2093) include:

*   Additional data downloaded from personal [strava account](https://www.strava.com/athletes/gregce)
*   CSS restyling improvements (line & axis -- per Assignment 3 feedback)
*   Interaction 1: Filter Update functionality
*   Interaction 2: Hover over tooltip

All source code also available as a [github gist](https://gist.github.com/gregce/c48a70a55bd8c2f80c8b)
