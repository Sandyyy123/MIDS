You may want to consider rewording for clarity, particularly as the article directly above the table specifically mentions two of the other responses (i.e. that pharma spends money on gifts, travel, etc. on potential clients, and it also specifically mentions the skepticism many hold in relationship to spending vs. prescribing). I am under the assumption that it meant total marketing dollars spent annually based on the assertion in the article citing the ACA requirement for companies to report all transfers of value to healthcare providers, as I am guessing this expense is considered marketing dollars by the individual companies.
